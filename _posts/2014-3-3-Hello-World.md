title: Privatized education
---

We as a society benefit financially from educating each other because it improves the career a person will have: education increases how much someone earns over their lifetime. The government takes a part of these earnings as taxes to retroactively pay for your education, and even if you're not paying taxes, having a certain level of income means the government won't have to pay you social security.

# Problem
In today's world, most education, especially education for children, is provided by the government. A common argument against state-owned organisations is that they're supposedly not effective at reaching their goal. How is our government's educational system doing in that regard? Let's look at some data. Here's a poll to collect the opinions of you and your follow readers.

The above poll shows that few of us think our education was optimal. Of course, it's easy to criticise and maybe our education was actually better than we think, but let's assume for now our collective opinion is pretty on the mark.

# Solution
Privatizing education can be done by letting the government sell a 'right to educate' contract that's tied to a specific person. Whomever owns the contract is paid a percentage of that person's earnings each year. Owning such a contract thus means you're incentivised to help that person get a great career, which you can do by educating them.

There are a number of problems with the above approach that we need to address:
- Lack of market interest due to long timelines.
- Lack of equality: talented students are given the best education while weaker students are left behind
- No incentive to provide educational value unrelated to prospective income
- Who decides which education provider may educate a student?
- Disregard for student happiness, education providers may choose to force a person into a career that while high paying, doesn't make them happy.
- Safety, what if an education provider isn't doing well, not allowing the student to reach their full potential?
- Implementation, how can we safely try out and switch to this system?
- Issues related to emmigration

## Lack of market interest due to long timelines
Educating a person is an extremely risky and long term investment. It's possible no private investors are willing to do this. Education contracts should be tradeable, so that one provider can sell a contract to another provider. This way, an education contract holder can make a profit simply by increasing the expected income of the student, without actually getting any direct payout from the contract.

To jumpstart the education contract trading market, the government should act as a buyer of education contracts, after which it will try to sell the contract again. If there's no buyer for the contract, the student will roll into a government provided educational system.

## Lack of equality
To make it more interesting to educate low potential students, the payout system should be non-linear, so low income earners pay out relatively more than high income earners. This makes sense from a government financial perspective as well, because society functions better if two people both earn X than if one person earns 2X and the other 0.

<!-- insert example income vs payout curve -->

## Government, parents and child all want to choose the education provider
How do we decide to which education provider to sell someone's right to educate? The government, the parents and the students are all stakeholders.

We propose that the government first filters the offerings of education providers, after which the parents must select one from the remaining list.

The government will likely filter out education providers that it does not trust to optimally use the right to educate. It might also filters out education providers that don't meet it's non-financial criteria such as a lack of physical or cultural education, or a lack of attention to student happiness

Also, education providers can differ in how much they're willing to pay to educate a child. An education provider might decide to educate a student more than is optimal from a profit perspective, "overeducating" the child so that while this may make them earn slightly more, the extra cost of education will be higher. Such an educator might ask for money to educate the child instead of pay for it.

## Disregard for student happiness
Education providers may choose to force a person into a career that while high paying, doesn't make them happy.

## Disregard for educational value that has no financial benefit
Education providers may differ in factors that don't necessarily relate to improved income, factors such as:
- Cultural education
- Religious education
- Physical education

## Bad education providers
What if an education provider is "undereducating" the child, not educating them well enough to get the most out of the right to educate.

Educational contracts are periodically appraised. The government will estimate how much the student will earn throughout their lifetime, and together with its estimations of costs to educate, will determine how much it thinks the right to educate the student is currently worth.

Right to educate contracts have a cancellation clause which can be invoked if the parents or the government are unhappy with an education provider, which likely happens if they think the provider is under-educating the child.

## Emmigration
What happens if a student decides to move to another country, where they won't pay taxes and it may not be possible to track their income? Will the holder of the 'right to educate' contract be left without a payout? In this case the government will make an estimate of what would have been paid out for that person per year, and pay that out on a yearly basis. If the person happens to immigrate back, the normal payment based on their income will continue.

Are there weird side-effects because contract holders might benefit from people leaving or staying in the country? Will they contact people and offer them money for saying or leaving?
