title: Privatized education
---

We as a society benefit financially from educating each other because it improves the career a person will have: education increases how much someone earns over their lifetime. The government takes a part of these earnings as taxes to retroactively pay for your education, and even if you're not paying taxes, having a certain level of income means the government won't have to pay you social security.

# Problem
In today's world, most education, especially education for children, is provided by the government. A common argument against state-owned organisations is that they're supposedly not effective at reaching their goal. How is our government's educational system doing in that regard? Let's look at some data. Here's a poll to collect the opinions of you and your follow readers.

The above poll shows that few of us think our education was optimal. Of course, it's easy to criticise and maybe our education was actually better than we think, but let's assume for now our collective opinion is pretty on the mark.

# Solution
At its core, privatizing education would mean the government would sell a contract tied to a person. Whomever owns the contract receives part of that person's lifetime earnings. Owning such a contract thus means you're incentivised to help that person get a great career, which you can do by educating them.

Educating someone is a net gain activity, meaning that the cost to educate is person is smaller than the return you get from their increased income. So, a company would pay money to get the right to educate someone, then pay money to actually educate them, and then only throughout that person's lifetime would they get paid out. Of course, no company is willing to make such a long term bet, but by selling the right to educate, to another education provider, after intermediate steps such as primary school, or a year of education, an educator can make profits in periods like a year.

# New problems

- Lack of 'fairness': talented students are given the best education while weaker students are left behind
- No incentive to provide educational value unrelate to prospective income
- Ownership, who decides which education provider may educate a student?
- Lack of choice, education providers may choose to force a person into a career that while high paying, doesn't make them happy.
- Safety, what if an education provider isn't doing well, not allowing the student to reach their full potential?
- Implementation, how can we safely try out and switch to this system?

To jumpstart this system, it would help if the government acts as a buyer and seller of education.

To make it more interesting to educate low potential students, the payout system could be non-linear, so low income earners pay out relatively more than high income earners. This makes sense from a government financial perspective as well, because society functions better if two people both earn X than if one person earns 2X and the other 0.

One question is how do we decide to which education provider to sell someone's right to educate? The government, the parents and the students are all stakeholders. And what if an education provider isn't doing well, can we force them to hand over the right to educate again?

Education providers also differ in factors that don't necessarily relate to improved income, like:
	- Cultural education
	- Religious education
	- Attention to student happiness
	- Physical education

Also, education providers can differ in how much they're willing to pay to educate a child. An education provider might decide to educate a student more than is optimal from a profit perspective, "overeducating" the child so that while this may make them earn slightly more, the extra cost of education will be higher. Such an educator might ask for money to educate the child instead of pay for it.

I think the government should be allowed to filter the offerings of education providers, after which the parents must select one from the remaining list.

The government will likely filter out education providers that it does not trust to optimally use the right to educate. It might also filters out education providers that don't meet it's non-financial criteria such as a lack of physical or cultural education, or a lack of attention to student happiness

What if an education provider is "undereducating" the child, not educating them well enough to get the most out of the right to educate.

Educational contracts are periodically appraised. The government will estimate how much the student will earn throughout their lifetime, and together with its estimations of costs to educate, will determine how much it thinks the right to educate the student is currently worth.

Right to educate contracts have a cancellation clause which can be invoked if the parents or the government are unhappy with an education provider, which likely happens if they think the provider is under-educating the child.
