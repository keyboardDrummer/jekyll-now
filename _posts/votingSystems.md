# Comparison of voting systems

## Plurality 

US presidential elections. Top 2 parties receive over 99% of the votes.
India. First and second parties receive >90% of the votes.

### Theory
Any recurring single-seat voting system will stabilize towards two parties becoming popular and every election being won by someone from either of those parties.

A single-seat voting system is one where there the vote has a winner who gets everything there is to win. A party is defined as a group of affiliated people. The above holds regardless of what single-seat voting system is used. For example, the following systems all stabilize into a binary choice: [Plurality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_voting), [Instant-runoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting) and [Approval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting) voting.

### Argument
In a single-seat voting system, voters should not blindly vote for their favorite candidate. If the candidate I vote on does not win, my vote is wasted, so I should vote on a candidate that I both like and has a chance of winning: what we generally call "voting tactically". To vote tactically I must know what the chances are of candidates winning, which I can do by looking at past election results and seeing how the current candidates are affiliated with past winners. However, the past election results were also determined by tactical votes. This creates a feedback loop that stabilises when only two popular parties remain.

To demonstrate that the two popular party state is the stable one, let's look at different states and see whether they're stable.
1. Only the top party has a high chance to win: voting tactically is not possible since the winner is already clear, so voters can simply vote on their favorite party. This means that current popular opinion determines the winner, which due to recent events might be a different party then the one that was predicted to win, so this state is not stable. It is possible that one party has a slam dunk victory and will be expected to win the next election as well, in which case we end up in state 1 again. However, it is also possible that one party wins but not slam dunk, in which case we end up in a different state.
1. Only the first and second most popular parties have a chance to win. Here tactical voting is possible by voting either the first or second party. Current popular opinion determines which of the two parties wins. Since all tactical votes go to either one of the two parties, next election only they will be considered to have a chance to win again, so this state is stable.
1. More than two parties have a chance to win. Here voters can vote tactically on any party that has a chance to win, but parties with a higher chance to win will get more tactical votes. Given repeated elections, this results in fewer and fewer parties still getting votes until we arrive in state 2.

The above three states cover all possible states, and only state 2 is stable so that is the stable one.

### Consequences
Assuming that we want to give voters more than a binary choice when voting, we must not vote for single-seats. 

### Alternatives
The above assumes that once a vote is cast, it is locked in for some significant amount of time. If instead we allow votes to be recast at any time, voters do not have to refer to past election results to determine how to vote tactically. They can simply vote their favorite candidate and change their vote if it turns out the vote was wasted. This positive effect may already occur if we only allow voters to vote multiple times.
