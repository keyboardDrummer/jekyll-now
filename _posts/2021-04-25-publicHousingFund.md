title: Preventing a Housing Crisis
---

Housing shortages and subsequent skyrocketing house prices are recurrent issues in regions across the globe. The human impact of these crises is substantial. When housing prices rise in an area, landlords often raise rents to match market rates, forcing long-term renters to relocate to more affordable areas, disrupting their social bonds and employment.

<!-- Change the next two paragraphs so they focus on renters not buyers. The solution in this article only helps out long time renters, not fresh buyers, although it helps people buy sooner, maybe? -->

<!-- People become so desperate to buy that they waste much effort trying to buy with relatively little to show for it. [Here's](https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2020/09/18/gun-mij-uw-huis-please-a4012705) a Dutch article that discusses in what creative ways buyers try to gain the favor of sellers in the hope this will land them the house. Real estate brokers argue that such favoritism hardly ever plays a role in who gets the house.

Some housing markets are so overheated that it becomes difficult to even arrange a viewing of the property. Viewing appointments are booked within a day of them becoming available, with sometimes over a hundred viewers coming to a single property. Prospective buyers are forced to use buying brokers to give them an edge in getting viewing appointments. -->

A frequently proposed solution to tackle overheated housing markets is the construction of additional houses. However, while new construction may help overall supply, it does not protect existing renters from being priced out of their neighborhoods. How can we address that?

### Risks of renting
Often people are scared to buy housing because they are worried that it is not the right time, that the housing market will drop after they buy, which means they could have saved money or bought a nicer home by waiting.

The real risk however is renting. If the housing market goes up, a renter will either have to pay an increased rent, or pay a higher mortgage when buying a home. In investment terms, you could say we are all 'going short' in real estate by default. It is only once we own housing that we become unaffected by the changes in the housing market. 

Many countries have laws that constrain rent prices, and one might consider these as a method to reduce the risk of renting. However, constraining rents in an increasing housing market leads to a shortage of supply, since commercial renters will profit more from selling their property instead of renting it out. Since the Netherlands accounced increasing regulation around rental prices on |date|, supply of rental properties has dropped so low that it is common for a single rental property to receive hundreds of applications, and rentees will generally overbid on advertised rental prices in a desparate effort to be picked. People who can not find rented houses may opt to use hotels or AirBnbs to prevent becoming homeless, so that they end up paying even more than unconstrained rent would have cost them.

A solution to lack of supply in a constrained rental market can be for the government to provide rental properties. This approach is used in the Netherlands, although these rental properties are available only to those with a lower income, and are thus called social housing. However, despite government subsidies, social housing has not managed to meet demand, and waiting times for social housing are generally over a decade.

An example of a country where government provided housing has largely managed to meet demand is Singapore. The majority of Singaporeans live in public housing. Allocation of public housing is done using a rule based system. For example, you will have a better chance at being provided housing if you have a family, or if you are a native Singaporean. A rule based approach is affective at preventing displacement despite increasing housing prices. The downsides of rule based approaches are that they provide little room for intelligent allocation beyond the intelligence that is backed into the rules. We believe that getting the most efficient allocation requires a market based approach, which is what we'll explore further in this article.

Note that a market based approach does not prevent equalising housing for rich and poor, since this can still be achieved through, for example, a redistributive tax system or income dependant housing subsidies.

### Promoting home ownership
A method governments have used to promote home ownership is by using tax incentives, such as allowing part of a mortgage to be tax deductible. These incentives increase the relative price of renting compared to buying, even though the latter is already cheaper. However, despite such cost reductions, many individuals continue to opt for renting due to several factors, such as uncertainty about preferred location, financial constraints in meeting upfront costs, and a lack of awareness regarding the long-term benefits of homeownership.

### Mandatory contributions
Many countries worldwide require their working citizens to contribute to various personal safety nets. For example, in the Netherlands it is mandatory to contribute part your income to personal pension fund. On average Dutch workers contribute 8% of their income to pensions. Similarly, it is mandatory for Dutch citizens to buy health insurance.

Considering that accomodation is a need just as essential as income and health, why is home ownership not mandatory?

## Housing fund
Our proposal entails mandating individuals with an income and residing in rented homes to allocate a portion of their earnings, referred to as the housing premium, to a designated housing fund. The housing fund will subsequently invest these contributions in residential properties that will be made available for rental purposes. This unique arrangement ensures that renters become partial owners of rental properties, simultaneously benefiting from the returns generated by these investments.

To maintain affordability and flexibility, the housing premium will be calculated as a percentage of the rental price paid by individuals. This approach empowers individuals to control the amount they contribute, enabling them to align it with their budgetary constraints.

### Region
A person may specify into which areas they desire their housing fund should be allocated. A person who is confident they will live in a particular city their entire life can allocate the entire investment there, while someone who has no idea where on the planet they might end up, may choose a global allocation.

### Buying & Selling
When an individual intends to purchase a house, their housing fund becomes accessible for the transaction. However, when the same person decides to sell their property, they are obligated to reinvest a portion of the sale value back into the housing fund, equal to or greater than the amount initially contributed when they purchased the property.

### Leverage
When individuals purchase a house, they typically utilize a mortgage, which is a form of leverage in investment terms, allowing them to increase their exposure to the property. While buyers contribute a deposit from their own funds, a significantly larger amount, such as ten times the deposit, is borrowed from a bank to finance the purchase. If the homeowner fails to make mortgage interest payments, the bank has the option to sell the house to recover the loan. The buyer's deposit serves as a safeguard, ensuring that the bank can recoup the loan even if the property's value has declined since the purchase. This leverage is beneficial as it enables buyers to fully acquire the house they require for residence, protecting them from housing price fluctuations.

In the housing fund scheme, a similar concept of leverage can be introduced. The government can augment individuals' exposure to real estate by providing loans, acquiring additional housing assets, and using the individual's housing premium and rental income to cover the interest. This approach works effectively as long as the housing premium remains stable. However, if the premium decreases below the interest rate, the interest becomes unaffordable, necessitating the sale of housing assets to repay the loan until the interest can be met once again. While this scenario is manageable when housing assets have appreciated in value, it becomes problematic if the assets have depreciated, leading to a loss of the individual's investment. To mitigate this risk, the government can limit the interest rate from leverage to ensure it is unlikely to exceed the housing fund premium. In the event of such a situation, the government can assume responsibility for covering the loss, safeguarding citizens' investments and preventing harm.

## Conclusion

In response to housing shortages and skyrocketing prices, we propose the implementation of a mandatory housing fund for individuals with an income living in rented homes. This fund would make renters partial owners of rental properties, offering them returns on their investments. Participants can influence the allocation of their contributions, and accumulated funds can be used towards home purchases. Leveraging can be introduced cautiously, managing interest rates and mitigating risks. Through these measures, we aim to address affordability, facilitate renters' path to homeownership, and ensure housing market stability for the benefit of individuals and communities.
