title: Dealing with migration - abolishing citizenship
---

How to deal with immigration is in the top three of most discussed topics in politics around the world. Political parties are founded on their stance on migration. In 2023, migration into the richest X% of countries was Y% of their population, while the birthrate was only Z%.

Common arguments for migration are potential economic benefits and social responsibility, while common arguments against are economic costs and feared affects on crime and societal systems such as education and healthcare.

This document explores what would happen if a country provides freedom of movement and employment to anyone, with the caveat that freedom of movement may be restricted if someone is deemed dangerous.

We think the primary advantage of this system will be more chances for people anywhere on this planet to build wealth regardless of their origins, an economic boost from more efficient matching of labor demand and supply, and lower transportation costs.

Downsides will be an increase in crime and due to more visibile wealth inequality. Rich and poor will be living closer together: inside the same border instead of in different countries.

### Philosophy
At the heart of this system is the desire to provide everyone on our planet with basic necessities: housing, social welfare, healthcare, education, infrastructure and protection against crime and natural hazards.

The system must be scalable: it must continue to work regardless of whom joins it, even if the entire world population joins. Because the cost of basic necessities has a lower limit, and the burden that those with employment can carry has an upper limit, the system can not always provide basic necessities to everyone.

The system must be sustainable, which can only be done through strict rules on procreation. A child may only be conceived if we can reasonably guarantee to provide it with basic necessities.

### Private services
Housing, social welfare, healthcare and education are private services. These are tied to individuals. Any individual who enters the system does not automatically receive private services: they must be bought. Anyone who has the means to buy them must do so. These services are bought for life, and financing this is done using a personal loan that is paid back during ones life.

A person, such as a parent, may help another person, such as a child, secure a loan by cosigning it.

Couples who wish to give birth must buy an option on private services for their unborn child before conceiving. Failure to do so is a crime and can lead to a fine or imprisonment.

### Public services
Protection against crime and natural hazards is a public service, as is the provisioning of public spaces such as streets and parks.

Public services are paid for through a tax on private services.

### Voting
Anyone who receives private services is eligable to vote.

### Wealth redistribution / charity



### Crowded

### Question
<How to deal with crowding of streets? Would that happen? Probably not. Would that fall under endangerment?>
<Would we then build wider streets? Walled off neighbourhoods?>

Ideally there would be no border whatsoever.

What are we giving?

Free infrastructure? Roads to walk and drive?

What do we do about services that can not be paid by usage?


### National security

Terrorism control at the border.

Control of imported items.

### Crime
We expect a greater wealth disparity, leading to more economic crime pressure.

We also expect cultural differences to lead to more perceived instances of aggression or micro aggression. There will need to be strict laws around micro aggression.

The additional crime pressure must be mitigated and in a scalable way. We will depend on cameras and AI to reduce the cost of the police force.

How can we scale up the legal system?

Based on the national budget, there will be a cap on the available prison capacity. If occupation goes above this cap, one option is the early release of prisoners, but this risks public safety. There are options that do not put public safety at risk but they are widely regarded as unethical.

One of these is forced prison labor, while another is corporal punishment. The unethical nature of corporal punishment may be reduced by providing the choice between that and incarceration.


### Infrastructure
All roads are toll roads. Any vehicle using them must pay for the distance traveled.


### Children
We want a society where there is social welfare, housing and education for everyone. To ensure this, there are strict rules on when a child may be conceived, violation of which is a crime.

Government may determine the expected profit or cost of an unborn child. 



// Build explanation.
Any parent who wants to have a child must buy disability ensurance before conceiving, or face criminal penalty. This ensurance costs a fixed sum that is paid incrementally during the period in which the child reaches working age.


Based on the national budget, a limited amount of capital will be spent on social security that will be available to anyone who needs it.

The amount of welfare available per person depends on the amount of people needing it. At some point, the amount reaches a floor, beyond which it will not be lowered. To still make the budget solvent, people will be served daily welfare using a queuing system. (Something better than a queue?)

The floor amount is set so that it is enough to provide shelter, a small amount of food, and enough clothing, of any quality, to protect against the local weather.

Social security at a level that allows one to level close to that of the working population, will have to be bought like a regular insurance. It will be easier and cheaper to buy based on your life history and that of your parents.

To ensure that most people have access to high-end social welfare, by law, work in this countries may only be performed by people who are socially insured. This means that people new to the workforce may obtain social security at the same time as their work contract. The duration of the social insurance is likely to be coupled to the duration of the work contract.

### Healthcare
Healthcare will be mostly similar to social security, with a certain amount of the national budget being used to provide conditionless healthcare.

Charity healthcare will be provided for the ailments where it is most effective, and when there is not enough budget, will be provided using a queueing system. (Something better than a queue?)

### Education
Anyone educated in this country, for the first X years of their carreer, pays extra income taxes and either:
- [If feasible] Must also do so when working outside this country
- [Otherwise] May not work outside this country
